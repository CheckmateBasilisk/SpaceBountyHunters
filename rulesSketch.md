### Mechanics
- Catch Up Mechanics: To keep all players interested, the first player to be killed by all other players gets to be an Avenger, a powerful space cop with special powers and benefits and a different Victory Condition. The second player that gets killed by everyone becomes the Antiquary, that recieves an Artifact Weapon and can buy Archeotech Ammo. The third player that gets killed by everyone becomes a Pirate, capable of hoarding more money.
- Catch Up Mechanics: Every collected Skull raises the Bounty of a player, incentivizing others to hunt down the most valuable heads and leave those behind to their own devices.
- No Player Elimination: Eliminated players would just be excluded from the group until the game ends. There's no value in keeping them around if they have no chance of winning.
- Interactivity: It is crucial to keep players on their toes and engaged in the game with the posibility of interaction out of their turns, such as instants in Magic. This is achieved through the Events and Trigger abilities from equipment or Abilities, also the Black Market.
